/// Pre-spawned engine-worker pool for parallel JavaScript execution over
/// synchronous host callbacks.
///
/// One `QuickjsRuntime` evaluates scripts one at a time on its owning
/// isolate; while a host function runs, that isolate's event loop is
/// frozen. This pool adds *engine-level* parallelism: it owns N worker
/// isolates, each running dispatched functions on engines the consumer
/// wires inside its own [AsyncWorkerMain]. The scripting surface stays
/// synchronous — `runAsync(fn, args)` returns a `Job` whose `wait()`
/// blocks the calling engine until the worker answers.
///
/// The pool owns the transport and lifecycle: worker spawning, handshake,
/// the dispatch/wait mailbox protocol, FIFO backpressure, fire-and-forget
/// envelope caching, and dead-worker completion. The consumer owns the
/// worker body — what "an engine" means for it (runtime creation, host
/// functions, per-worker resources, teardown).
///
/// Boot discipline (same as any FFI-hosting isolate setup): [AsyncEnginePool.boot]
/// spawns the worker isolates and handshakes their inbox ports and MUST run
/// while the main event loop is alive (e.g. from `main()` before any JS
/// evaluates). `Isolate.spawn` cannot make progress while the spawning
/// isolate is blocked inside an FFI callback.
///
/// Mechanism:
/// - [AsyncEnginePool.dispatch] is normally called from JS on the main
///   engine — i.e. from inside a blocked FFI callback. `SendPort.send` is
///   a native non-blocking call, so it works there.
/// - [AsyncEnginePool.wait] parks the calling OS thread on a
///   `Mailbox.take()` (native pthread condvar — no event loop needed)
///   until the worker puts the job envelope. The worker isolate keeps
///   running on another VM thread while the main engine is blocked.
///
/// Backpressure: there are exactly `workers` engines. Dispatch claims an
/// idle worker; when all workers are busy it blocks (FIFO) on the oldest
/// busy worker's completion — jobs queue by dispatch order.
///
/// There are no timeouts: a dispatched function that never returns blocks
/// its caller forever, exactly like a main-script infinite loop would.
///
/// Failure paths: the worker body answers every dispatched job (`ok:false`
/// + error text on any failure — `runAsyncJobOnRuntime` captures JS
/// evaluation errors, and wrapping the body's execution in try/catch covers
/// host/executor errors); a worker isolate that exits is marked dead by an
/// exit listener and its undispatched jobs are completed with an error
/// envelope. Residual gap: a `wait()` already parked on a dead worker's
/// mailbox still blocks.
///
/// Fire-and-forget jobs are legal: completed envelopes nobody waited for
/// are cached and served if [AsyncEnginePool.wait] comes later, and
/// [AsyncEnginePool.dispose] asks the workers to exit (they finish any
/// in-flight job first).
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Top-level (or static) — an entry point must cross the isolate spawn.
/// Future<void> workerMain(AsyncWorkerLink link) async {
///   final runtime = myWiredRuntimeFor(link.workerId); // consumer setup
///   try {
///     while (true) {
///       final request = await link.next();
